      <p> The last few months, I've been working on   me, baby<br>
          There's so much trauma in my life<br>
          I've been so cold to the ones who loved me,   baby<br><br>
          I look back now and I realize<br>
      </p> 
	  
      <p> I remember when I held you<br>
          You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay<br><br>
          And I regret I didn't tell you<br>
          Now I can't keep you from loving him, you made up your mind<br><br>
      </p> 

      <p> Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time<br>
          Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time<br>
          Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time<br>
          Said, I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (ah)<br>
       </p>
